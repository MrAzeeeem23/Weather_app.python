# Weather App in Python

🔰 This project showcases software development with Python, helping to understand Python programming, GUI creation in Python, and API integration.

🔰 To run this code on your PC, you need to install all the required Python libraries.

🔰 The API used in this project is from OpenWeatherMap.

🛑 NOTE: THIS WON'T WORK IF YOU HAVEN'T INSTALLED PYTHON AND ITS MAIN LIBRARIES

**Required Libraries:**
1. `pyinstaller`
2. `tkinter`
3. `requests`
4. `bootstrap`
5. `pytz`
6. `timezonefile`
7. `geopy`

*All important libraries are included in this app.*

❗**NOTE:** I also created an executable file (.exe) in case the script doesn't work. You can download the .exe zip file from my website.

❗❕ If you download the .exe zip file, Windows Defender might trigger a warning because it does not recognize the file as an executable. ❗

⭕ To resolve this, you need to grant permission to Windows Defender to allow the file on your device. ⭕

2️⃣ After installing the .exe zip file, extract all files from it, then run the main.exe file as administrator.
🛑 If it doesn't run, drag the img-folder into the main.exe file and try again.
